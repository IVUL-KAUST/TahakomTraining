{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Introduction\n","\n","Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA)\n","\n","In real-world applications, machine learning models are often trained on a dataset that is not perfectly representative of the domain where the model will be deployed. This difference between the source domain (where the model is trained) and the target domain (where the model is applied) is called **domain shift**, and it often leads to a significant drop in performance when models trained on the source domain are tested on the target domain.\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n","<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/v3x80W9/Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-11-24-32-AM.png\" alt=\"Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation\" border=\"0\" width=400>\n","</div>\n","\n","Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) is a technique designed to address this problem through unsupervised domain adaptation. The key idea is to transfer the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by aligning the feature distributions between the two domains, See above Figure. ADDA achieves this through a two-step process:\n","\n","1. Feature learning on the source domain: A feature extractor is trained on the labeled source domain in a supervised manner.\n","2. Adversarial adaptation for the target domain: The model then uses adversarial training to align the target domain features with those from the source domain, ensuring that the feature representations are domain-invariant.\n","\n","The method is inspired by the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where a domain discriminator attempts to distinguish between source and target domain features, while the target feature extractor learns to fool the discriminator by producing features that are indistinguishable between domains.\n","\n","Objectives:\n","\n","- Learn domain-invariant features: Align the feature spaces of the source and target domains without requiring labels from the target domain.\n","- Improve generalization: Train a model that performs well on the target domain despite the domain shift.\n","\n","This notebook will guide you through the implementation of ADDA, covering key steps such as:\n","\n","- Pretraining a feature extractor on the source domain.\n","- Applying adversarial training for domain adaptation.\n","- Evaluating the performance on the target domain.\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you will understand how adversarial techniques can be used to adapt a model to a new, unlabeled domain.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Model Overview\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n","    <img
